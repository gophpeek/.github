# PHPeek

You don’t need to be a geek to peek.

## Scope
PHPeek is the base layer for inspecting how your systems and Laravel applications actually behave. Metrics are the first step. The roadmap includes deeper introspection, runtime signals, analysis tools and autoscaling logic.

## Projects
- **laravel-queue-metrics**  
  Measures queue pressure, throughput, latency and worker behaviour. First release pending.  
  https://github.com/gophpeek/laravel-queue-metrics

- **system-metrics**  
  Collects CPU, memory, load, disk and network signals. Released.  
  https://github.com/gophpeek/system-metrics

- **laravel-queue-autoscale** *(coming)*  
  Scaling driven by measurable pressure.  
  *(Repo will be added when published.)*

- **laravel-queue-monitor** *(coming)*  
  Tracks each job’s execution details with full processing metadata and supports job replay.  
  *(Repo will be added when published.)*

- **laravel-queue-dashboard** *(coming)*  
  Visual inspection of queue state and worker efficiency.  
  *(Repo will be added when published.)*

- **baseimages** *(coming)*  
  Streamlined PHP images for development and production with tuned entrypoints, health checks and clean shutdown handling.  
  *(Repo will be added when published.)*

## Direction
Expose real behaviour instead of assumptions. Build a unified operational layer for Laravel and system environments.
